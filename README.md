# User Manual For Working with MMS/Mary

Tips and tricks for working with me.

**Pronouns:** she/her/hers

## My Values

- Honesty
- Tranparency
- Grit
- Care for Others

## What Motivates Me

- People. I care a lot about building relationships and building strong teams of people. When people have strong, trusting, open and honest relationships, they can work miracles together.
- Making people's lives better and fixing things. I love going into a situation where everything is a mess, and wrangling it to a place where people feel motivated, have good work/life balance, we're making customers happy, and things are operationally sustainable.
- I like doing hard things. I will often pick the hardest thing I can think of to do and go after that.
- If you're into the BICEPS model, my most important core need is Improvement/Progress. I get frustrated when things aren't moving or we keep making the same mistakes without learning. Conversely, I love making things better and I love growing and improving teams and myself.
- If you're into the SCARF model, my most important core need is autonomy. I like large problems that my teams and I can solve with maximal autonomy possible.

## Me as a Manager

- Everything is possible. I have seen time and time again that nothing is impossible as long as you work hard, think creatively, and believe you can do it.
- Push decisions out to the edge. I think the people who are closest to the work are the best equipped to make the right decisions, and my job is to give them as much context, information, and strategy insight as possible so they can make the right decision.
- Treat people like adults. Give them all the information, even if it's bad, and help them process it. If people will react immaturely to something, give them the information anyway, and coach them on their reaction.
- Collaboration. I love getting in a room with a team and hammering out a solution together rather than dictating one.
- Process should be as lightweight as possible. Process should make things faster and safer, not slower and frustrating. I hate process but build it all the time where needed. I know "people over process" is an overused phrase - I align with that pretty well, and would rephrase it as "I trust people to do the right thing, and process is just there to make it easier for them to know how".
- What I like to see in managers: people that build healthy, thriving teams where team members are growing and feel psychologically safe, and their teams get shit done.
- Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Belonging: this is table stakes.

## How to make me annoyed or at least roll my eyes inwardly
- Stagnation
- Arrogance
- Bureaucracy
- Bikeshedding
- Judging people based on anything but their abilities
- Telling me why we can't do it and should all just give up anyway
- Dad jokes

If you notice me getting annoyed, feel free to call me out that I seem annoyed and I'll calm right down.

## Tips and Tricks

- I want to hear what's broken, especially if you have a solution for how to fix it. I'm a fixer and I love being surrounded by people that spot problems and want to improve them.
- I love feedback because I'm a perfectionist and I always want to get better. I prefer feedback in an asyncronous format (like Slack) so that I can digest and ask thoughtful questions, but I will happily take it in whatever form you can give. It is most important to me that we retain a positive relationship.
- I love giving feedback when I feel comfortable doing so. If I'm giving you feedback it's because I beleive in you and think you can get better. I stop giving feedback when I know it's not being heard or is unwanted.
- I love creative solutioning. It brings me a lot of joy when I'm thinking of a problem from a specific direction and someone finds a side door or sidesteps the problem entirely.
- Rule-breaking sparks joy for me, both when others do it and when I get to
- I highly value clear, succint communication. I feel most natural when I'm using a casual and crisp communication style.
- I spent a lot of my formative software engineering years in DevOps. I'll talk your ear off about monitoring, architecture, hardware, and ops battle scars.
- If you tell me I *can't* do something, I'm definitely going to do it.
- If you like personality tests (I always take them with a grain of salt):
  - SDI: Blue
  - Myers-Briggs: ENFJ
  - Enneagram: 7
  - DnD alignment: chaotic good
- I'm very into food and drinks and I travel a lot. I could talk for hours about cooking, good restaurants and bars, or travel recommendations. I'm also an avid exerciser: running, biking, swimming, yoga, hiking, or any random exercise class you can think of are all fun to me.
